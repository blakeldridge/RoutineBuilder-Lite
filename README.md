# RoutineBuilder-Lite

This project marks the simplified rebuild of my Gymnastics Routine Builder.

The goal?

To create a MVP for my website, so that people can begin to use it and get the word out.

## Outline
This website will allow gymnasts to build routines on each apparatus, and have the difficulties automatically calculated, allowing them to experiment with new routine ideas and aid the competition preparation.
